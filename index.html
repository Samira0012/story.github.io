<h2 id="about">About me</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Samira, hailing from the vibrant country of Azerbaijan. My journey into the world of Salesforce began shortly after my graduation in 2017, and since then, I've dedicated myself to mastering the intricacies of Salesforce administration and development. While my formal education and certifications have laid a strong foundation, it's my continuous thirst for knowledge and the drive to provide efficient solutions that truly define my professional ethos.

    But Salesforce isn't just about codes and configurations for me; it's about building meaningful connections. Just as Azerbaijan is known for its rich history and a tapestry of cultures, I believe in weaving diverse threads of information, technology, and user needs to craft comprehensive CRM solutions that stand the test of time.
    
    Outside the digital realm, I deeply cherish the moments I spend immersed in Azerbaijan's traditions, enjoying our music, food, and the warmth of our community. It's this balance of modernity and tradition, technology, and culture, that makes me who I am â€“ a Salesforce enthusiast with a heart rooted in Azerbaijani values.
